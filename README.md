# Day 1 — Restarting My Web Dev Journey

I'm restarting my learning journey in web development.

This repo will include:
- my daily/weekly notes  
- small practice files  
- simple projects  
- things I'm learning as I go  

Today's practice:
- Created a basic HTML file  
- Re-learned the structure (html, head, body)  
- Focus: starting small and staying consistent
